Framer Motion :

    1) motion :

        > If we want to animate anything it should be wrapped with motion
        > <motion.div> </motion.div>
        > It will take props as a input

            * animate - it takes an object it conatains end state
            * initial - it contains initial state
            * transition - {
                delay 
            }

        > properties

            * x
            * y
            * rotate
            * delay

    2) Integrating with state:

        const [rotate,setRotate] = React.useState(false)

         <motion.div animate = {{
            rotate : rotate ? 360 : 0
        }}>
